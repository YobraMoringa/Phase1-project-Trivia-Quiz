# Phase 1 Final Project: Trivia Quiz Game

## Description

This project is a Single Page Application(SPA) for a multiple choice interactive quiz game. The game includes:

* A start page with a "Start Quiz" button.
* Multiple-choice questions with options. Only one answer is correct.
* A score tracker that keeps track of how many questions were answered correctly.
* At the end of the quiz, show the userâ€™s score and an option to restart the quiz. 

It tests the 3 pillars of web programming which are:

1.  **DOM Manipulation:** Select, create or remove specific HTML elements and dynamically style them in CSS using JavaScript
2.  **Recognizing Events:** Add event listeners to buttons and forms that will trigger callback functions when the events are detected
3.  **Communicating with the server:** Send requests and get responses from the server

The user can:

1. Click on "Start Quiz" button to start answering questions.
